1. I implemented a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods like Credit Card, PayPal, and Cryptocurrency.
The Strategy pattern was applied to allow dynamic selection of payment methods at runtime. By creating a PaymentStrategy interface and concrete classes like CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, the system can easily switch between payment strategies.

2. I created a weather monitoring system where different types of displays (current conditions, statistics, and forecast) automatically update when the weather changes.
The Observer pattern manages the relationship between the WeatherStation (subject) and WeatherDisplay (observers), ensuring that all displays are notified of updates from the station.

3. I built a universal remote control for smart home devices like TVs, lights, and stereos, with options to execute and undo actions.
The Command pattern encapsulates each action as a command object. Command classes like TurnTVOn, DimLights were created, and a RemoteControl class manages command execution and undo operations.

4. I designed an order processing system where the behavior changes based on the order's current state (e.g., New, Paid, Shipped).
The State pattern was utilized by defining different states such as NewOrderState, PaidOrderState, and transitioning the order between states based on user actions like payment or shipping.

5. I implemented an expense approval system where expense requests go through a chain of approvers depending on the request amount.
The Chain of Responsibility pattern was used by creating a chain of approvers (TeamLead, Manager, Director, CEO). Each approver decides whether to approve or pass the request up the chain.

6. I developed a chat room where users can send messages through a central mediator, facilitating communication between users.
The Mediator pattern was implemented by creating a ChatRoom mediator that handles communication between User objects, simplifying interaction between users.

7.  I built a version control system that allows users to save and restore different versions of a document.
The Memento pattern was applied by creating a DocumentVersion class to store document states and a VersionControl class to manage saving and restoring document versions.

8. I created a system to calculate the area of various shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) using the Visitor pattern.
The Shape interface was created, and the Visitor pattern was used to implement an AreaCalculator class, which calculates the area by visiting each shape.

9. 
I implemented a report generation system that creates different types of reports (PDF, HTML, Plain Text) while keeping the overall process consistent.
The Template Method pattern was utilized by defining an abstract ReportGenerator class with steps for report creation. Concrete classes like PDFReportGenerator and HTMLReportGenerator format reports differently.

10.  I designed a playlist management system that allows songs to be traversed in different orders (sequential, shuffle, filtered by genre).
The Iterator pattern was applied by creating different iterator classes like SequentialIterator and ShuffleIterator, allowing the system to traverse songs in multiple ways.
